# About us
---
Hello we are Siho and Aidan and we are highschool students from California. We are the founders of Project Palsy and we strive to make innovative solutions for those affected by disabilities such as Cerebral Palsy.

When we aren't striving to make a difference, we enjoy cycling, trying out local food spots, and cooking. We are both competitive people and we enjoy playing tactical sports.

Our commitment lies in pioneering new avenues of accessibility and potential for those affected. We understand the necessity for substantial progress in this realm and pledge to remain at the forefront of it. We sincerely appreciate your engagement and invite you to accompany us on this meaningful journey.
