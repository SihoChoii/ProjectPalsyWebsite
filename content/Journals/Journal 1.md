# Our Methodology

### Website
In order to document our journey of creating Project Palsy, we decided to use markdown language because it allow for efficient formatting in a lightweight and universal package. Although markdown language was intentionally developed to be readable in plain text, it did not have the polish we were looking in order to share to the public.

*Raw Markdown Language Example*

For this reason we decided to use markdown language along side a interpreting layer that would convert the markdown syntax into a nicer format. For this we chose Obsidian, a markdown language editing app, and Quartz, a tool that uses the Hugo framework in order to convert markdown syntax into a fully functioning website.

### Branding
We started our brainstorming ideas for our [[Branding]].

As two high-schoolers looking to brand their passion project, we had multiple criteria for the aesthetic of our brand. We decided on Project Palsy since it was simple and reflected our goals at their core motives. Along with this, we chose a hand aesthetic for all of our logos.
