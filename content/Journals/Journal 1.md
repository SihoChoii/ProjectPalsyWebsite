# Our Methodology

### Documentation
In order to document our journey of creating Project Palsy, we decided to use markdown language because it allow for efficient formatting in a lightweight and universal package. Although markdown language was intentionally developed to be readable in plain text, it did not have the polish we were looking in order to share to the public.

*Raw Markdown Language Example*

For this reason we decided to use markdown language along side a interpreting layer that would convert the markdown syntax into a nicer format.

*Obsidian View vs Raw Markdown Syntax vs Hugo Website*

>The final workflow we decided on was:
> [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/) -->  [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) --> [**Quartz**](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) --> [**Github Pages**](https://pages.github.com/)

We decided to use Obsidian to edit and stylize the markdown text due to its excellent flexibility. It offers the ability to download community themes and plugins which greatly increase its utility and creates a unique system for "connecting" different pages to each other. As you can see, the graph view feature provides an unique interactive and visual representation of the connections between the journals.

In order to convert the markdown journals to website ready code we decided to use Quartz which packages the Hugo framework to work with Obsidians non standard markdown syntax. 
Finally we chose Github Pages to deploy the website due to its ability to directly pull the website files from a repository which dramatically simplifies the process.

### Branding
We started our brainstorming ideas for our [[Branding]].

As two high-schoolers looking to brand their passion project, we had multiple criteria for the aesthetic of our brand. We decided on Project Palsy since it was simple and reflected our goals at their core motives. Along with this, we chose a hand aesthetic for all of our logos.
