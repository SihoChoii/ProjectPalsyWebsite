## The Overlooked Impact of Cerebral Palsy in Society: Exploring the Potential of Motion-Based Games as a Therapeutic Intervention.

**Abstract: Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect an individuals’ motor skills, muscle coordination, and movement overall. Despite being a very prevalent disability, Cerebral Palsy is often overlooked, leading to less resources for those affected, especially for children. This project aims to explore the potential of motion based games as a form of therapy for children with CP, as well as develop a stimulating motion based game that targets muscles in the hands, specifically increasing the motor skills and hand-eye coordination for youth affected by CP. By examining existing scientific works, this research portion of the project will aim to identify benefits in exergaming, as well as discuss the importance of giving aid to those affected by CP. 

  
> 1. Introduction
    

1.1 Background and Significance 
    

Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a disorder that is directly linked to motor control. For individuals, this can mean having little hand-eye-coordination or poor posture. CP has an incidence rate of 1 in 300, affecting many hundreds of thousands nationally.
