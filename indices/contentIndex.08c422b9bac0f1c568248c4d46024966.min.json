Although markdown language was intentionally developed to be readable in plain text, it did not have the polish we were looking in order to share to the public. \n\n![[images/J1/Markdown Example.png]]\n*Raw Markdown Language Example*\n\nFor this reason we decided to use markdown language along side a interpreting layer that would convert the markdown syntax into a nicer format. For this we chose Obsidian, a markdown language editing app, and Quartz, a tool that uses the Hugo framework in order to convert markdown syntax into a fully functioning website.\n\n\u003e [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/) --\u003e  [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) --\u003e [**Quartz Github**](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\n\n![[Pasted image 20230722204548.png | 200]] ![[Pasted image 20230722204656.png | 250]]\n*Obsidian View vs Raw Markdown Syntax vs Hugo Website*\n\n### Branding\nWe started our brainstorming ideas for our [[Branding]].\n\nAs two high-schoolers looking to brand their passion project, we had multiple criteria for the aesthetic of our brand. We decided on Project Palsy since it was simple and reflected our goals at their core motives. Along with this, we chose a hand aesthetic for all of our logos.\n\n\u003e Some ideas:\n\n![[images/J2/logo1.png|340]] ![[images/J2/logo2.png|340]]\n\n![[images/J2/logo4alt.png|340]] ![[images/J2/logo3.png|340]]\n\nNext Journal [[journals/Journal 2|Journal 2]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-23T03:50:31.162565429Z","tags":["Journal"]},"/Journals/Journal-2":{"title":"Journal 2","content":"\n### **Mission**:  Implementing exergaming to assist children with cerebral palsy, further enhancing their motor skills through performance and usability.\n---\nWhile we knew we wanted to focus on the development of a game to assist our patients the theoretical applications of exergaming were broad, and multiple solutions could be effective.

We also decided on small features such as a wrist strap addition to improve the quality and safety of use. The shape was kept simple in order to make it easier to fit the larger prototype electronic components. Our first model:\n\n![[images/J1/caddingg.jpg]]\n*Autodesk Fusion360: Modeling the Controller*\n\nThe IMU we chose for this project was the MPU6050 since it struck a good balance between features, accuracy, and price. It has the ability to sense acceleration as well as rotation in six axis, affording us creative freedom in designing our therapy game. \n\n![[images/J1/final imu.gif]]\n*3 Axis Accelerometer Gyroscope Module 6 DOF 6-axis Accelerometer*\n\nAfter gaining a rough idea of the final controller, we decided to start designing the internal specs. We began soldering and working on the internal hardware of our device, specifically the integration of the inertia measurement unit.\n\n![soldering](images/J1/soldering.gif)\n*Soldering the inertial measurement unit (IMU)*\n\nThe inertia measurement unit (IMU) will be a key factor in assisting the hand-eye-coordination of our patients. This will give us the ability to sense motion, and would be a key component in the exergaming interaction.\n\nFor our first prototype, we decided to the the Arduino Uno R3, which allowed us to easily prototype our first iteration of the circuit. However, it comes with the drawback of missing the ability to USB output which limits it's use to just serial outputs. \n\n![[images/J2/mcus.jpg]]\n*Arduino Uni, Metro Mini, Pi Pico, Pro Micro*\n\n\n![[images/J2/imutest.gif]]\n*IMU testing with serial monitor*\n\n### Software\nIn order to test the sensors functionality, we used the Adafruits MPU6050 library create a test program.\n\u003e [**IMU Test Code Github**](https://github.com/SihoChoii/ProjectPalsy/blob/main/Software/v1/main/main.ino)\n```cpp\n#include \u003cAdafruit_MPU6050.h\u003e\n#include \u003cAdafruit_Sensor.h\u003e\n#include \u003cWire.h\u003e\n\nAdafruit_MPU6050 mpu;\n\nvoid setup(void) {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n  while (!Serial)\n    delay(10); // will pause Zero, Leonardo, etc until serial console opens\n\n  Serial.println(\"Adafruit MPU6050 test!\");\n\n  // Try to initialize!\n  if (!mpu.begin()) {\n    Serial.println(\"Failed to find MPU6050 chip\");\n    while (1) {\n      delay(10);\n    }\n  }\n```\nThe test program reads the data off the IMU and prints values into the serial interface.\n\n### Game Design\nWhile brainstorming ideas for the game, we had to keep in mind several criteria, including the constraints of the IMU. While we initially took a more motion based approach to our game, we realized that the IMU did not have the ability to capture precise 3D motion. However, due to its gyroscope sensing capabilities we decided to focus on the rotational aspect on our game, which would still help train motor control.\n\nSince rotation based movements mostly involve a shift in perception, we knew that it was necessary to make the game in 3D. \n\n![[images/J2/monkeyclip.gif]]\n*Super Monkey Ball Gameplay*\n\nBased on the constraints of the IMU and our desire to take a more rotation-based approach, the initial inspiration for our game was Super Monkey Ball.  While the game seems mechanically demanding, our approach would optimize gameplay to be slower and focus more on precise controls over Super Monkey Ball's rapid and speed based gameplay. This would allow for our game to both have an easier learning curve and build up on difficulty in levels, allowing for the steady growth in motor skills for our players. \n\nIn order to make a game that is both visually appealing and within our criteria, we decided to use the industry standard game engine Unreal. The endless powerful tools that Unreal Engine has gives us creative freedom with our game design. \n\n![[images/J2/unreal.gif]]\n*Unreal Engine 5.2 Demo*\n\nThe properties of physics that our game will be using are demonstrated here:\n\n![[images/J2/Sequence 01.gif]]\n*Ball Physics Demo*\n\nNext Journal [[journals/Journal 3|Journal 3]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-23T03:50:31.162565429Z","tags":["Journal","GameDesign","GraphicDesign","Hardware","Software"]},"/Research/Research":{"title":"Research","content":"\n## The Overlooked Impact of Cerebral Palsy in Society: Exploring the Potential of Motion-Based Games as a Therapeutic Intervention.\n\n**Abstract: Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect an individuals’ motor skills, muscle coordination, and movement overall. Despite being a very prevalent disability, Cerebral Palsy is often overlooked, leading to less resources for those affected, especially for children. This project aims to explore the potential of motion based games as a form of therapy for children with CP, as well as develop a stimulating motion based game that targets muscles in the hands, specifically increasing the motor skills and hand-eye coordination for youth affected by CP. By examining existing scientific works, this research portion of the project will aim to identify benefits in exergaming, as well as discuss the importance of giving aid to those affected by CP. \n\n### 1. Introduction\n    \n#### 1. Background and Significance \n    \nCerebral Palsy (CP) is a disorder that is directly linked to motor control. For individuals, this can mean having little hand-eye-coordination or poor posture. CP has an incidence rate of 1 in 300, being the most common neuromotor disability, and affecting many hundreds of thousands nationally. \n\nCerebral Palsy has long affected humans dating far back to ancient civilizations. However, it has not been until recently in the 18th and 19th centuries that studies have been done on cerebral palsy, and the term Cerebral Palsy itself was not coined until the 20th century. The National Library of Health cites that “Osler, Sach, and Peterson, Sigmund Frued, Mac Keith and Polani” were key contributors in the studies of CP, eventually leading to the term being defined in 2006. Along with this, only in recent years have MRI been developed powerful enough to scan and diagnose CP by viewing parts of the brain. With Cerebral Palsy being diagnosed early through MRIs just recently, new physical therapies have also been developed through different neuroscience studies allowing for early therapy and rehabilitation for patients suffering from CP. \n\nDespite these recent advancements, for such a prevalent disability Cerebral Palsy still lacks societal perception and support. While many scientific findings have been recently made, public perception of Cerebral Palsy still lags far behind recent scientific advancements. One of the key reasons for this, is the lack of widespread education on Cereberal Palsy. Many people do not know the causes, types, or effects of CP. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vcpkOL8-f51oVs2p_bvAL0elnJhLH0xgOAaeIruoSbHd6nFPEwiNa3rsh8xFHClDdiN7-zbTKAfLuXaz1GculSO_THa_XzKmj9BrhT7syRlx2HIm5p9vTJu56XOXCqQwBqan04dEwEQ48HeHw4wf4ls)\n*National Library of Medicine - Types of Cerebral Palsy*\n\nIt is imperative that we as a community learn more about Cerebral Palsy in order to create a more supportive environment for such a common disability. One consequence of this lack of education in CP is that many might have misunderstandings or inappropriate reactions around those with CP. While our project is about the Dyskinetic portion of CP, overall we hope that the research and initiatives that we spread will further create a more supportive and inclusive environment. Through this passion project, we hope to increase the quality of life for all affected by overlooked disabilities. \n\n#### 1.2 Objectives and Goals\nTo raise awareness about the overlooked status of cerebral palsy in society, this project aims to bring attention to the challenges faced by individuals with Cerebral Palsy and provide a more modern solution to them. By highlighting the prevalence and impact of cerebral palsy, the project seeks to raise awareness, and bring upon ideals of community empowerment to those suffering from overlooked disabilities. \n\n- To explore the potential of motion-based games as a modern therapeutic treatment for individuals with cerebral palsy: The research paper aims to investigate the role of motion-based games, such as those enabled by motion-capture technology and virtual reality, as an innovative approach to supporting individuals with cerebral palsy. By examining existing literature and studies, the paper will assess the benefits and limitations of incorporating motion-based games into rehabilitation and therapy programs.\n    \n- To examine existing literature and research on current physical treatments of CP: This examination will focus on the potential therapeutic effects of current existing treatments, and compare them with motion based games in terms of increased motor function, cognitive development, and overall quality of life for individuals with CP.\n    \n- To create a project that fosters community empowerment, raising awareness for individuals with CP while also aiming to optimize the integration of motion-based games in the management and treatment of cerebral palsy. This project will propose awareness and be published, increasing resources for the lack of understanding in Cerebral Palsy. \n    \nOverall, the research paper seeks to contribute to the growing body of knowledge surrounding cerebral palsy and motion-based games. By evaluating the potential benefits of these games and addressing the underlooked status of cerebral palsy in society, the paper aims to promote a more comprehensive and compassionate approach to supporting individuals with CP and enhancing their quality of life.\n\n### 2. Cerebral Palsy: Current Treatments and Effects\n    \n#### 2.2 Diagnostic Challenges\n\nDiagnosing cerebral palsy is a complex process that requires specialized medical expertise and thorough assessments. The diagnosis is often based on clinical observations, developmental history, and neuroimaging studies. Recently, with the addition of MRI brain scans have been a largely helpful tool in identifying Cerebral Palsy. \n\nEarly intervention is crucial for individuals with cerebral palsy, as it allows for timely support and therapeutic interventions during critical periods of development. Recent studies have also been completed to show when Cerebral Palsy develops in children. \n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oxtDpQcoO2XzOb6Z81rgIRrOLfWKDvFJl3OHteXSe8U1BOsUO5aApW_ehbgAx91yd6905H-NCbeQzh5yxNI2RXM32lBAO8ltyHm3vfmCZ9XtTifhtTBcKYCP8pYOvzvoIHMXrOXYm8F_4TjsvtEELqE)\n*National Library of Medicine - The Development of Cerebral Palsy in Children*\n\nWith kids, usually the hands and arms are more affected by the legs. Common side effects include “Increased spasticity in flexor muscles, sensory abnormalities, seizures, and visual problems are common findings” (*A Review on Recent Advances of Cerebral Palsy* National Library of Health). Furthermore in the same article they categorize Cerebral Palsy in 5 different cases, “diplegic, hemiplegic, tetraplegic, ataxic, dyskinetic, and mixed [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9356840/#B21). Hagberg however classified CP into spasticity, dyskinetic syndromes, and ataxia. The spastic syndrome occurs due to damage to the brain and tracks controlling movement. It can be divided into monoparesis, hemiparesis, triparesis, tetraparesis, and spastic diplegia. Dyskinetic symptoms are seen due to injury to the subcortical structure, and ataxic symptoms are seen due to cerebellar injuries dividing CP into spastic, affecting one or both sides of the body, dyskinetic involving involuntary movements with altered tone or choreoathetosis movements, and ataxic. Around 80% of CP cases are found to be spastic [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9356840/#B22). Spastic CP in this context is characterized by increased muscle tone and increased reflexes. It has been subcategorized into unilateral or bilateral along with the area of involvement. SCPE refers to dyskinetic CP accounting for 10 to 20% of CP cases and presents as having involuntary, uncontrolled, repetitive, and sometimes stereotypical movements with a fluctuating muscle tone. A faulty posture with enhanced muscle tone is defined as dystonic; a quick, uncontrolled, and twisting movement with hypotonia is called choreoathetosis. On the other hand, ataxic CP consists of 5-10% of CP cases and presents with loss of coordination with hypotonia. In some children, damage may occur in different parts of the developing brain which causes them to develop symptoms of having a combination of two or more types of cerebral palsy. This type is called mixed CP which accounts for 15.4 percent of all cases. The most common presenting symptoms of mixed type are a combination of spastic and athetoid features,” \n\n#### 2.3 Current Therapy for Cerebral Palsy\n\nCurrent treatments for CP are very traditional and cookie cutter. According to an article from the Springer Nature Group, current treatments include “rehabilitation, physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, medical, splinting, casting, braces or orthosis, and other treatments.” While surgery is also an option, oftentimes many patients see surgery as a last resort. \n\n| Treatment / Procedure                   | Yes | No  | Total |\n|----------------------------------------|-----|-----|-------|\n| Non-surgical treatment rehabilitation  | 78  | 122 | 200   |\n| Physical therapy                       | 182 | 18  | 200   |\n| Occupational therapy                   | 42  | 158 | 200   |\n| Speech therapy                         | 62  | 138 | 200   |\n| Medical therapy                        | 172 | 28  | 200   |\n| Splints                                | 35  | 165 | 200   |\n| Casts                                  | 24  | 176 | 200   |\n| Braces or orthosis                     | 47  | 153 | 200   |\n| Other                                  | 0   | 200 | 200   |\n| Tenotomy                               | 15  | 185 | 200   |\n| Tendon lengthening                     | 46  | 154 | 200   |\n| Tendon transfer                        | 10  | 190 | 200   |\n| Surgical treatment muscle lengthening  | 42  | 158 | 200   |\n| Neurectomy                             | 20  | 180 | 200   |\n| Capsulotomies                          | 7   | 193 | 200   |\n| Osteotomies                            | 19  | 181 | 200   |\n| Arthrodesis                            | 2   | 198 | 200   |\n| Selective rhizotomy                    | 0   | 200 | 200   |\n| Multilevel surgery                     | 0   | 200 | 200   |\n| Spine surgery                          | 0   | 200 | 200   |\n*Springer Nature Group - Current CP Treatments*\nThis chart shows the commonality of each treatment. \n\nWhile many of these treatments can be effective, they lack the modernness of today's society and lack the stimulating aspect that motion-based games have. There is a growing interest in exploring innovative solutions that also achieve a rehabilitation aspect, which is what our project aims to do.\n\n### 3. Motion-Based Games : A modern approach to rehabilitation\n    \n#### 3.1 The evolution of Motion Based Games.\n\nAs technology rapidly improves year by year, the growth in the motion game industry has revolutionized entertainment, and more recently therapy.Early motion-based gaming systems, such as the Nintendo Wii, introduced simple motion-sensing controllers that allowed players to engage in virtual games by moving parts of their bodies and holding a controller.. Subsequently, advancements in technology led to the development of more advanced platforms, such as the Microsoft Kinect and virtual reality systems.\n\nThe Microsoft Kinect, released in 2010, eliminated the need for handheld controllers, enabling users to interact with games using just their body parts. This marked a significant step forward in motion-based gaming, as it allowed players to be more immersed and feel connected to their game. VR systems, on the other hand, transport users into virtual environments, allowing for even more immersive and interactive experiences. Recently, the Oculus Quest has been a leading innovation in the field of virtual reality, selling over 20 million VR headsets. With its innovating design that prioritizes comfort and allows for extended use, this device was a leading inspiration in our project. \n\nRecently, these interactive games have been implemented into healthcare and rehabilitation. Being innately fun and stimulating, they are strong therapy games for the youth and elderly. In an article titled The Use of Motion-Based Technology for People Living With Dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Literature Review by the National Library of Medicine, experiments were done allowing for the elderly affected with Dementia and Parkinsons to utilize pre-developed systems such as the Nintendo Wii as therapy. Principally, the experiment found it difficult to introduce the games to the elderly and explain the device. In our project we hope to imitate this concept with our own self-designed system, and target physical and cognitive stimulation in Cerebral Palsy.\n\n#### 3.2 Benefits to Motion Based Games\n\nThere are several benefits to motion-based games as therapy tools. Firstly, in regards to the target audience of children who are affected by Cerebral Palsy, they are often more engaging and stimulating, serving to build up problem solving skills while also being fun. Motion-based games often require individuals to make quick decisions, solve problems, and process visual and auditory information while engaged in gameplay. These cognitive challenges stimulate brain activity and promote neuroplasticity, potentially enhancing cognitive abilities over time. This coupled with the increased focus form the game being fun makes the game very effective. \n\nFurthermore these games often utilize different mechanics of your body, such as reaching, grasping, balancing, and stepping, which target different muscle groups. As a result, individuals with cerebral palsy can experience unique and progressive therapy that aligns with their specific motor challenges and goals. The interactive and rewarding nature of motion-based games leads to more engaging therapy sessions, and can also lead to increased mental health and confidence due to the fun nature and the improved muscle growth from playing. Specifically with our game, coordination will be a key factor leading to increased motor control as well as hand-eye coordination. \n\nMost importantly, as a form of treatment the progress of these motion-based games can be easily tracked, making it so that adjustments can be made and the treatment can be personalized. The data collection that comes from playing these games will be used in order to enhance the physical therapy potentially leading to more effective outcomes. \n\n#### 3.3 Game Design Consideration\n\nThe game design criteria is harsh when making a suitable game for those affected by Cerebral Palsy. Game design elements, such as clear instructions, intuitive controls, and adjustable difficulty levels, can enhance accessibility for individuals with cerebral palsy. Customizable settings that cater to specific needs, such as adjusting game speed or motion sensitivity, ensure that the games are engaging and challenging for all players. Additionally, because some cases of CP may be more severe than others, it is essential that there is a level or difficulty adjuster to accommodate all types of persons. \n\nThe game must also be easily taught to therapists or caregivers utilizing it as a form of therapy. Along with this, they should be familiar with the data collection so they may customize the game to suit their own needs. \n\nWhen creating the controller for our project, it is imperative that we consider crucial quality of life features such as an ergonomic design for prolonged use, simple and easy to click buttons, and an arm strap to enhance the quality of use and add a layer of safety.\n\n### 5. The Integration of Motion Based Games\n\n#### 5.1 Approaches to Outreach\n\nIntegrating motion-based games into clinical practice requires a slow approach that involves collaboration between the developers, therapists, and Cerebral Palsy organizations. Therapists can incorporate these games into individualized treatment plans, setting specific goals and tracking progress over time. The first step to outreach for our project would be contacting local Cerebral Palsy organizations in order to collect data and test our game. \n\n#### 5.2 Challenges to Integration\n\nDue to the varying levels of CP, the motion-based game must be accommodating for all types of severity. Additionally, while it is easy for us to use our own game, we will eventually need to train therapists and the patients themselves, meaning the game must have an easy learning curve Since our game is independently developed, there is no initial cost and therefore will be easy to implement. We hope that our game can be the initial investment to begin a trend of motion based rehab for those with neuromotor disabilities. Our eventual open-source game development will make us a resource for all further therapeutic game developers.\n\nWhile there is not much research on the long term effects of motion-based therapy, we hope that we can pioneer the connection between healthcare institutions, and game developers increasing the integration of motion-based games into rehabilitation programs, ensuring their widespread availability and effectiveness in cerebral palsy management.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, motion-based games offer a promising shift in cerebral palsy management, presenting a modern take on therapy, while being stimulating and targeting motor, cognitive, and social aspects of rehabilitation. As we strive for a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to support individuals with cerebral palsy, we are proud to be the pioneers in a modern era of problem solving and innovation. \n\nWe hope to work with local Cerebral Palsy organizations to all play vital roles in the successful integration of motion-based games into clinical practice. By collaborating, sharing knowledge, and investing in research and training, we can unlock new methods and more effective methods of rehab, under a common goal.\n\nLet us work collectively to raise  awareness about cerebral palsy and the potential benefits of motion-based games in rehabilitation. By doing so, we can create a more compassionate, inclusive, and supportive environment that empowers individuals with cerebral palsy to lead fulfilling and rewarding lives.\n  \n# **Our Mission**:  Implementing exergaming to assist children with cerebral palsy, further enhancing their motor skills through performance and usability.\n  \n\n\n## Works Cited\n\n**National Library of Medicine**\n\n- **Title:** Cerebral palsy in children: a clinical overview\n- **Author:** National Library of Medicine\n- **Publication:** PubMed Central, 2022\n- **URL:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7082248/\n\n**ResearchGate**\n\n- **Title:** Personalization of a virtual gaming system for children with motor impairments: performance and usability\n- **Author:** Zhang, Y., et al.\n- **Publication:** ResearchGate, 2022\n- **URL:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353316964_Personalisation_of_a_virtual_gaming_system_for_children_with_motor_impairments_performance_and_usability\n\n**The Globe and Mail**\n\n- **Title:** Video games are helping children with cerebral palsy\n- **Author:** Globe and Mail\n- **Publication:** YouTube, 2022\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzN22NUbEss\n\n**Cureus**\n\n- **Title:** Effectiveness of treatment in children with cerebral palsy\n- **Author:** Ayaz, S., et al.\n- **Publication:** Cureus, 2022\n- **URL:** https://www.cureus.com/articles/43953-effectiveness-of-treatment-in-children-with-cerebral-palsy#!/\n\n**ScienceDirect**\n\n- **Title:** The effects of virtual reality on gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis\n- **Author:** Li, H., et al.\n- **Publication:** ScienceDirect, 2022\n- **URL:** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212868921000647\n\n**PubMed Central**\n\n- **Title:** The history of cerebral palsy: from antiquity to the 21st century\n- **Author:** Rosenbaum, P., et al.\n- **Publication:** PubMed Central, 2012\n- **URL:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5266826/\n\n**Cerebral Palsy Guidance**\n\n- **Title:** History of cerebral palsy\n- **Author:** Cerebral Palsy Guidance\n- **Publication:** Cerebral Palsy Guidance, 2022\n- **URL:** https://www.cerebralpalsyguidance.com/cerebral-palsy/research/history/","lastmodified":"2023-07-23T03:50:31.170565477Z","tags":["Research"]},"/journals/Journal-3":{"title":"Journal 3","content":"\n### Documentation\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-23T03:50:32.358572589Z","tags":["Journal"]}}
